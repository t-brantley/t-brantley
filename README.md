I am a dedicated college student who is currently enrolled in Florida Atlantic University for a B.A. in Computer Science. I am eager to apply my passion and knowledge of coding to further my experience.

As a progress through my academic program, I am actively seeking opportunities to apply what I have learned.  Whether it's through coursework or personal coding projects, I am committed to honing my skills and gaining valuable hands-on experience.

Throughout my work experience, I have gained valuable skills in communication, leadership, multitasking, and more. I am looking forward to utilizing these skills as I progress in my software development career.
